## **Recursion**

A function that call that function itself inside of it
Recursion is good when doing repeated task

**Use cases**

- Searching through all the files in the folders
- Nested Objects to get values

## Base Case to stop function running recursively:

- There is Always a base case and make sure you return it otherwise you will get `undefined` in the end

- identify the base case
- Identify the recursive case
- Get closer and closer and return when needed. Usually you have 2 returns inside the function
