## **Recursion**

A function that call that function itself inside of it
Recursion is good when doing repeated task

**Use cases**

- Searching through all the files in the folders
- Nested Objects to get values

## Base Case to stop function running recursively:

- There is Always a base case and make sure you return it otherwise you will get `undefined` in the end

- identify the base case
- Identify the recursive case
- Get closer and closer and return when needed. Usually you have 2 returns inside the function

There are times when you need to keep DRY
less loops and less confused

Recursion is not always the best approach
It creates extra memory footprint
There is high chances of stackoverflow

Recursion are mainly used:

- Graph traversal
- Tree Traversal
