# Queues
you can think about que as a line to restaurant or a people waiting in que at govt offices, which is FIFO manner

First in first out


enqueue = O(1)
dequeue = O(1)
peek=O(1) // whats the first item that is going to comeout
lookup =O(n)


You can build Queues with Arrays and LinkedList, but since enqueuing is O(1) its better we go with linkedlist
