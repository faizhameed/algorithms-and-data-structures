Number of arrays
You are given an integer N. Your task is to determine the number of arrays of length N such that it satisfies the following conditions:

Each value of the array is between 0 to 5, inclusively
XOR sum of all value of the array is zero
Note: Since the answer can be large, print the answer modulo 109+7

Input format

First line: T denoting the number of test cases
For each test case:
First line: Integer N denoting the length of the array
Output format
