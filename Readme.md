## What is Data structure?

Its the way of organizing data such a way that it can be accessed quickly and easily 

### Why data structure

They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
They help to manage and organize data effectively
They make code cleaner and easier to understand

## Abstract Data Type and Data Structure

An Abstract Data type is an abstract data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure musr adhere to.

The interface dose not give any specific details about how something  should be implemented or in what programming language


## Big-O Notation

It give the upper bound of complexity in the algorithm in the worst case, helping to quantify performance as input size becomes arbitrarily large

### Big-O Notation

Constant Time:O(1)
Logarithmic Time:O(log(n))
Linear Time:O(n)
Linearithmic Time:O(n(log(n)))
Quadratic Time: O(n^2)
Cubic Time: O(n^3)
Exponential Time: O(b^n)
Factorial Time:O(n!)
