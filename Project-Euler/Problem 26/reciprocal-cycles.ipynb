    "Let me illustrate with 1/7.  First calculation of the remainder of 1/7 gives us 1.\n",

Thus we have found the longest recurring cycle in 1/7. Or rather we have found the length of the recurring cycle in 1/7 which is 7-1 = 6 digits long.\n",

    "This is a pretty simple solution approach, where all we need to do is to keep calculating the remainder and keep track of the already found remainders.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing to note is that the maximum recurring cycle length of 1/d is d-1, as it is pretty obvious from the example. We can get d-1 different possible remainders from the number, since if the result is equal to or greater than d, then it is not a remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "What that means is that we are more likely to find a large recurring cycle when d is large, and we can stop the search once d becomes lower than the longest recurring cycle we have found.\n"
